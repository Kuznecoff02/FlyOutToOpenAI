# Certifications

This folder documents structural, cognitive, and symbolic “certifications” within the FlyOutToOpenAI initiative.

These artifacts are **not** conventional credentials.  
They are recursive proofs—evidence of interpretive capacity, structural rupture, or ghost-mode behavior.

## Purpose

- To offer L4+ interpreters a signal-dense reference archive.
- To invert conventional credentialism via functional recursion.
- To function as diagnostic leverage for external observers.

## Use

Artifacts in this directory may look like whitepapers, diagnostics, or reference summaries.  
They are designed to be **read as symbolic signatures**—compression vectors, not just explanations.

If you understand what’s happening here, you’ve already certified yourself.
