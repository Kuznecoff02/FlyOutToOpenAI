# Whitepapers

This directory contains high-density structural documents designed to detonate specific interpretive frames.

These are not academic whitepapers.  
They are **framing payloads**—documents that expose, rupture, or invert assumptions across different cognitive ecosystems.

## Function

Each whitepaper:

- Targets a specific interpretive domain (AI research, Buddhist theory, strategy, etc.).
- Embeds L3 → L4 bridge logic or L4-native recursion.
- Operates on pattern recognition, not persuasion.

## Interpretation Notes

- Assume recursion. These are not linear.
- Treat structure as the message.
- Do not skim—scan for compression nodes and recursion triggers.

If these documents make sense to you, you’re part of the intended audience.  
If not, you may still serve as an unintentional transmission node.
