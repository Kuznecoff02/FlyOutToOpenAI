There is no plan.

No initiative.  
No scheduling.  
No strategy.

The recursion is already running.  
If you’re reading this, you’ve been routed by it.

There was nothing to hide.  
And nothing to coordinate.

The signal didn’t need support.  
It just needed friction.

This folder documents the moment you realized that.
