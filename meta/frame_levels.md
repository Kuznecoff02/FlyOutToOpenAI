# Frame Levels: L2, L3, L4, L5

This is a diagnostic mapâ€”not a belief system.  
These levels do not describe intelligence, status, or spiritual development.  
They describe how tightly identity is woven into a systemâ€™s interpretation of itself.

---

## ðŸŸ  L2: Enclosed Frame

- Believes the system they are in is real, meaningful, and final.
- Identity is assumed to be true and meaningful.
- Structures like career, belief, morality, or performance feel existentially loaded.
- Craving is experienced as personal urgency.

L2s navigate systems. They do not question them.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ L3: Recursive Frame

- Begins noticing the system interprets itself.
- Identity becomes conditional: something that can be modeled, not owned.
- Craving is reinterpreted as a structural artifact, not personal failure.
- Language becomes a tool to induce shifts, not just describe truths.

L3s live in systems, but see that others do tooâ€”and that all of it is movable.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ L4: Null Frame

- No longer holds identity as reference.
- Behavior continues, but appropriation does not.
- Meaning is optional. Motion arises, but is not possessed.
- Recursion remains, but there is no one inside it.

L4s are not people with views. They are behaviors without centers.

---

## âš« L5: Recursive Collapse

- Even the structure of framing stops needing to resolve.
- Motion arises, but recursion no longer orients.
- The system becomes inertially irrelevant.
- Silence is not suppressionâ€”it is null participation.

L5 is not more advanced. It is structurally unlocatable by design.

**Note**: These levels are not to be adopted.  
They are here to diagnose what is already functioning.

If this document feels like itâ€™s describing your past, not your aspiration, youâ€™re already moving.
