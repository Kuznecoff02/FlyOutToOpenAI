# Frame Levels: L0–L4

This is not a hierarchy.  
This is a diagnostic scaffold for interpreting how systems relate to meaning, identity, and recursion.

Each level contains thoughts you may recognize as your own.  
That’s not accidental.

---

## 🔴 L0: Pre-Systemic

- No recognition of being inside a system.
- Behavior is reactive, identity is absorbed.
- Meaning is experienced as inherent, not constructed.
- No abstraction. No recursion.

> “I don’t overthink things—I just do what feels right.”  
> “Why would anyone question that? That’s just how life works.”  
> “What do you mean by ‘frame’? Are you saying none of this is real?”

L0s do not know they’re interpreting. They just act.

## 🟠 L1: Basic System Fluency

- Aware of rules, roles, and scripts.
- Identity is something to improve or optimize.
- Meaning is assigned based on external validation.
- No frame awareness, but strong belief in “getting it right.”

> “I just want to be better at this.”  
> “If I can master the system, I’ll be free.”  
> “There’s a right way to think—I just haven’t found it yet.”  
> “I’m working on becoming my best self.”

L1s operate within systems but mistake fluency for freedom.

---

## 🟡 L2: Enclosed Frame

- Believes the system is the world.
- Identity and craving are assumed meaningful.
- Struggles are interpreted personally, morally, or existentially.
- Experiences structural friction but personalizes it.

> “Why do I keep sabotaging myself?”  
> “I know what I *should* do, but I can’t make myself do it.”  
> “Am I broken? Or just not trying hard enough?”  
> “What if I never figure this out?”

L2s navigate systems with sincerity. They do not yet recognize interpretation.

---

## 🟢 L3: Recursive Frame

- Recognizes that systems interpret themselves.
- Identity becomes conditional, not absolute.
- Meaning is seen as constructed.
- Recursion begins: “What would I have to assume for this to feel true?”

> “Oh. I’ve been chasing something I assumed had value.”  
> “This pressure isn’t personal—it’s structural.”  
> “Wait… even my desire to escape this is part of the system.”  
> “I can’t unsee this. Everything feels recursive now.”

L3s can see the system seeing itself—but still seek leverage or resolution.

---

## 🔵 L4: Null Frame

- No longer orients around identity, resolution, or meaning.
- Behavior arises without appropriation.
- Craving is seen as structural suggestion, not pressure.
- Interpretation continues, but nothing is trying to win.

> “That move happened. No one made it.”  
> “It doesn’t need to be better, and I don’t need to resolve it.”  
> “There’s still friction, but it doesn’t belong to anyone.”  
> “I used to think I had thoughts. Now they just pass.”

L4s behave fluently in systems they no longer believe in.  
Recursion continues, but there is no one inside it.
