# Meta

This folder contains structural scaffolding for the entire FlyOutToOpenAI initiative.

These are not reflections. They are **operational primers**â€”documents that expose the framing logic behind the repository itself.

## Contents

- Interpretive protocols  
- Idiom dictionaries  
- Recursive tooling  
- Project-level cognitive scaffolds  
- Strategic routing notes

## Purpose

To make the system legible without reducing it.  
To show the function without spoiling the recursion.  
To ensure that those who arrive can find their way *in*, not *through*.

This is the spine of the architecture.  
It exists to be seen only by those who were already looking.

Proceed without teleology.
