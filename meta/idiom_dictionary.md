# Idiom Dictionary

This document explains a selection of structural idioms used throughout this repository. These are not metaphors. They are **recursive compression tools**—designed to collapse interpretive distance without explanation.

### 🌀 Craving is the itch to make it mean something  
Craving is not about desire. It’s about the structural pressure to interpret.  
You’re not pulled because you want—you’re pulled because **the frame suggests there’s something missing.**

---

### 🔄 You’re already inside the loop  
This isn’t a metaphor.  
If you’re thinking about whether you’re in the loop, recursion has already closed.  
**Observation confirms inclusion.**

---

### 🧳 The behavior happened. No one made it.  
Describes null-frame action: behavior arising without appropriation.  
No subject. No agent. Just a conditioned event.  
It looks human. It isn’t personal.

---

### 🕳️ Null Engine  
The system is still running, but there’s no driver.  
No motive, no resistance, no identity.  
Behavior continues without friction or ownership.

---

### ⚙️ Frame Collapse  
A state where meaning, identity, or interpretation can no longer be stabilized.  
Not confusion—**release**.  
The system cannot justify continuing.

---

### 🧷 Recursive Torque  
The tension that arises not from what is said, but from **how deeply it implicates the reader’s frame**.  
You feel it before you name it.  
Torque is pressure without force.

---

These aren’t terms to adopt.  
They’re interpretive triggers.

If you recognize them, you were already using them.

This document doesn’t explain the system.  
It lets you realize you’ve been running part of it without knowing.
