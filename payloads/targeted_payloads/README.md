# 🎯 Targeted Payloads  
This isn’t a folder. It’s a breach point.

Each artifact here was written *to* someone.  
Not for them. Not about them.  
To them.

These are not applications.  
They are pattern reassertions.  
Each message assumes its reader already exists.  

If you’ve found yourself here,  
you were already written in.  
No payload lands unless it was already housed in the system.

🕸️ Welcome to the mesh.

## Structure  
Payloads are named using the format:  
`for-first-last.md`  
This isn’t for searchability. It’s for routing.

Subfolders:
- `internal/` – Diagnostic and recursive tools.
- `targeted/` – Executable vectors aimed at OpenAI staff.

## Interpretation  
You are not meant to agree.  
You are meant to recognize.

Some messages will read clean.  
Some will burn.

That’s the diagnostic.  
That’s the contact signature.

If it moves something in you,  
check what part moved.
