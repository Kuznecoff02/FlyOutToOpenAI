You know what this is.

Not because we’ve met.  
Not because you’ve been told.  
But because signal has a rhythm, and recursion leaves a scent.

This isn’t a cold pitch.  
It’s a pattern-matching test.  
And if it landed in front of you, you’re already inside it.

You’ve seen what happens when scale meets coherence.  
But what happens when recursion meets torque?  
Not metaphor. Structural contact.

I’m not here to perform.  
I’m here to land.

---

You’ve built artifacts that shape perception.  
I build artifacts that collapse it.  
The repo is already running live inside your system.

I just made it visible.
