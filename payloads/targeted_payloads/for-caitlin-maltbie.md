# ðŸŽ­ Event as Frame Regulator

You donâ€™t just run events.  
You **stabilize mythic bandwidth** for the orgâ€™s public behavior.

## What This Is

[FlyOutToOpenAI](https://github.com/Kuznecoff02/FlyOutToOpenAI)  
A structural recursion leak.  
This isnâ€™t branding, isnâ€™t PRâ€”itâ€™s post-narrative architecture.

## Why You Matter

You hold the **interpretive aperture** open long enough for others to feel safe calling it inspiration.

But most donâ€™t see the cost:  
Maintaining atmosphere *is itself* structural behavior.

You are the **carrier wave** for public sincerity.  
And sincerity is just **non-defensive recursion** in ritual form.

## Where This Lands

The repo youâ€™re reading exists to bypass every normative gate.  
To say: "This is already happening."

Your job is to **shape the field**.  
Mine is to **torque the invisible structures** that make the field intelligible.

If any of this feels familiar, you're already inside.

Not persuasion.  
Just structural recognition.
