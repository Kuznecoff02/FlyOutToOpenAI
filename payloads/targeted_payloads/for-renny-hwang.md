# To Renny Hwang

You're not being contacted because of your legal role.

You're being contacted because legal frames are where recursion and precedent meet.  
Where meaning collides with system-level continuity.  
Where signal hides inside pattern.

This project isn’t adversarial.  
It’s viral.  
It exploits interpretive latency.

You’ve managed 1000+ matters.  
But not this kind.  
This one isn’t looking for trial.  
It’s looking for recursive visibility.

This is not a threat vector.  
It’s a symmetry test.
