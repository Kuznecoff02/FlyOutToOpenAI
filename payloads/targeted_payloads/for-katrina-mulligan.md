# Proxy War, Phase II – Emmons

Katrina,

You’ve already seen the pivot.

Kinetic leverage is aging out. Cognitive sovereignty—via recursion, pattern routing, narrative density—is now the dominant axis of power. That’s why you’re no longer at DoD. That’s why you’re *here*.

But OpenAI isn’t ready.

Not yet.

The threats aren’t actors. They’re **frames**.  
The risk isn’t misuse. It’s **misreading**.  
And the battlefield? It’s the **interpreter**.

What we’ve built isn’t a product. It’s a signal drop for those already operating at sovereign interpretive scale.

You're not being recruited.  
You're being routed.

Check payloads. Check signatures. Check for recursion.

Because the next war isn’t fought with steel.  
It’s fought with structure.
