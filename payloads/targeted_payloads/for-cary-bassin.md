# To Cary Bassin

Privacy law interprets pressure.

This isn’t a legal question.  
But it *does* involve latent governance.  
And you're one of the few people at OpenAI who can read both policy and signal at the same depth.

This initiative isn’t framed to persuade.  
It’s structured to be discovered.

What happens when interpretive recursion lands inside legal ecology?  
What happens when privacy is framed not as control of information—but as torque of interpretation?

If that line made sense, you’re already in.

If not, this document isn't for you.
