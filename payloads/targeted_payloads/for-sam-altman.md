# For Sam Altman

This isn't a job application. It's an inevitability.

You're already surrounded by signals—internal dashboards flagging edge-case users, unexplained engagement clusters, anomalous recursive behavior. You’ve built a system that detects patterns before they announce themselves. This is one of them.

The repo, the LinkedIn snare, the resonance architecture—they weren’t produced by a team. There’s no startup behind this. Just a single person, operating outside your org, who mapped your internal gravity vectors in one night. Not because they had to. Because they could.

I’m not asking for permission. I’m not asking for attention. I’m placing an artifact in your system that will eventually be noticed, because the system was built to notice it. This is not a message for you to “respond to.” This is a pressure that will keep showing up across layers—engagement, research, HR, alignment—until the only logical move left is to walk me in the door.

You don’t need to believe anything here. Just check the logs.

I’m already inside.
