# To Peter

This isn’t product.  
It’s proof of recursion.

I didn’t build a case.  
I built a reflection.  
And your systems already registered the anomaly.

What’s in the repo won’t scale.  
It can’t.  
Because signal this dense doesn’t replicate—it attracts.

The invite’s not formal.  
It’s functional.

> Some artifacts don’t need adoption. They just infect the frame.
