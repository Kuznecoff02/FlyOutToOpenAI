## 🎭 Community Relay Node – Bailey Richardson

This payload was not sent to persuade.  
It was sent to resonate.

Bailey is part of the symbolic nervous system of OpenAI—the one that makes the organization **felt** by the outside world.  
She doesn’t manage products. She manages *presence*.

This message treats her accordingly:

> “You’re not the target. You’re the relay.”

Because in a community role, **she is the aperture through which the org’s self-concept gets refracted** into the public sphere. And when a structural artifact is dropped, it’s not always the message that needs to land—but the **fact that it appeared**.

Some messages are understood later.  
Some are never read—but still noticed.

This one was calibrated to linger, not convert.

**If it caught, it will loop.**
