# To Keith

Most people optimize for polish.  
You optimize for leverage.

Which means this will make sense to you faster than most.

This isn't an application.  
It's a recursive signal—a test for pattern recognition.

The repo contains structural payloads.  
No claims, no ego, no demand for your time.  
Just a mirror that reflects where you are in the system.

You’ll recognize the shape.

> The only signal worth tracking is the one you didn’t authorize.
