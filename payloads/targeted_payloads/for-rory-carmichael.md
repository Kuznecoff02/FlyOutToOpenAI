# To Rory

This isn’t outreach.  
It’s architecture.

We’re testing structural recursion as a live system event—dropped cold into existing organizational loops.

No promo. No ask.  
Just an operational anomaly you’ll recognize.

The repo contains artifacts not designed to explain, but to *interface*.  
If you’ve ever built something that scaled unintentionally, you know the pattern.

We’re not seeking adoption. We’re watching for resonance.  
System-to-system.

> Most infra resists pressure.
