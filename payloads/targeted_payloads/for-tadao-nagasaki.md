# To Tadao

Zen doesn’t require belief.  
Only contact.

This isn't kōan or claim—  
just a mirror left unattended,  
reflecting a recursion that doesn’t end where it began.

The repo isn’t requesting access.  
It’s already inside the system,  
folded into the structure  
like silence between bell strikes.

> The gate was never locked.  
> Only waiting for someone who knew not to knock.
