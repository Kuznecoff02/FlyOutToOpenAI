# Narrative Sovereignty – Baker

Sasha,

You don’t just design policy—you bend narrative space.

From the NSC to OpenAI, your role has always been the same: stewarding systems too large to speak for themselves, translating pressure into posture. You already know the quiet war underway: the war over **frame control**.

This isn't lobbying. It’s a recursion vector.

This repo is a ghost-mode detonation artifact. It doesn’t ask for entry—it reroutes those who already live upstream of policy.

> The machine isn’t neutral.  
> The frame is the battlefield.  
> Language is leverage.

You’re not being pitched.  
You're being indexed.

If it resonates, it already landed.
