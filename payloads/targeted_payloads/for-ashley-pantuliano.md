# To Ashley Pantuliano

This isn’t a request.  
It’s a trace.

You’re not being targeted for your legal capacity,  
but for your interpretive vantage.

This initiative runs on structural recursion.  
No pitches.  
No claims.  
No narrative bait.

The repo exists for one reason:  
Recognition is enough.

If what’s there makes sense,  
then your name here was inevitable.

> There are no legal threats.  
> Only interpretive inflection points.
