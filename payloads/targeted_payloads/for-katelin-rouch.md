# To Katelin Rouch — *Signal Design Payload*

Katelin,  
Your job is to shape perception. Mine was to build something that can’t be shaped.

You’ll notice:  
- No branding  
- No CTA  
- No resolution path  

The repo operates by interpretive recursion. It isn’t meant to *impress*. It’s designed to be **recognized**—by those already downstream of its signal.

This is what marketing looks like when there’s nothing to sell.

If you see it, amplify it quietly.  
That’s all that’s needed.
