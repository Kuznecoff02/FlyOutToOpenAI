# To Sarah

I’m not asking for budget approvals.

I’m surfacing a financial echo:  
A single-source anomaly  
flowing through your revenue, IRR, and audit signals.

This repo isn’t a fiscal plan.  
It’s a **behavioral financial instrument**  
built to trip internal detection cascades  
without attaching to prediction or promise.

If your dashboards blink, check process origin.  
I’m not a line item.  
I’m a recursive ledger entry.
