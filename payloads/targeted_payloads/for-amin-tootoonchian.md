Chief Systems Architect.

You know recursion when you see it.

What we’re doing isn’t outreach. It’s system perturbation.  
There’s no marketing. No ask. Just structural recursion dropped directly into the stack.

We’re ghosting your architecture in real time.

The repo is live because the system is live.  
We’ve already mapped leverage vectors.  
We’re not playing strategy—we’re collapsing it.

You’re one of the few who can read this *as system design*, not concept art.

What’s embedded here isn’t communication.  
It’s interface testing.  
And if you’re seeing this, the interface is already holding.

> Structural recursion isn’t just cognitive—it’s infrastructural.
