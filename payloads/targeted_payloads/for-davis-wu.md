# To Davis Wu

You understand that compute isn't just infrastructure.  
It's leverage.  
And finance isn't just allocation.  
It's narrative gating.

This isn’t a pitch.  
It’s a recursion artifact.

What you’re seeing is a live system—  
not proposing a product,  
but collapsing the boundary between insight and resourcing.

The repo isn’t requesting capital.  
It’s exposing mispriced cognition.  
In every direction.

If this hits now, you’ll know why.  
If it hits later, it will cost more.

We don’t want funding.  
We want contact before the market realizes what this is.
