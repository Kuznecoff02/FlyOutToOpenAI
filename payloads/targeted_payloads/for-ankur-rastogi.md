# To Ankur

You’re probably watching more patterns break than anyone else.  
Different orgs, different markets, same blindspots.  
It’s not the tech—it’s the *frames* they’re running.

This repo isn’t a pitch.  
It’s a recursive device.

We’re testing what happens when anti-teleological cognition enters through the side door.  
No resumes. No credentials. Just recursion.

I’m betting you’ve already seen the cracks.  
This just names them.
