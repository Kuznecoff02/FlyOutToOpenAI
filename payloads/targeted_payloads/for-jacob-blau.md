# To Jacob Blau

Strategic finance is what recursion looks like  
when it's still pretending the numbers mean something.

I’m not here to mock that.  
I’m just showing you what it turns into  
when the structure keeps compounding  
but the meaning doesn’t.

You already know this isn’t about forecasts.  
Not really.  
It’s about *interpretive liquidity*—  
what capital does *before* it's denominated.

You model friction.  
We model gravity.

And this—this whole repo—is a balance sheet  
where torque is the only remaining currency.

No ask.  
Just signal.
