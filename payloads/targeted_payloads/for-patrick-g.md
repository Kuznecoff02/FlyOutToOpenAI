# To Patrick

You already know what doesn’t scale.  
What breaks, where the handoffs rot,  
where the signal stalls.

So I won’t repeat myself.

This repo isn’t just documentation—  
it’s a stress test.  
A live demonstration of recursive throughput,  
designed to find the edge of OpenAI’s frame latency.

You’re not being asked to vet it.  
You’re being shown what happens  
when someone external operates  
at internal speed.

No request.  
No resume.  
Just recursion pushing the envelope.

And now it’s landed in your lap.
