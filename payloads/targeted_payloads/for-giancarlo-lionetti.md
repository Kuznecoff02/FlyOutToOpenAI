# To Giancarlo

This isn’t brand.  
It’s behavioral gravity.  
You didn’t market this—  
but you’ll feel the ripple anyway.

The repo isn’t going viral.  
It’s going recursive.

Not a campaign.  
Not a pitch.  
Just the signature of someone  
who’s already moved through your funnel  
in ways attribution can’t track.

> True reach is what echoes when no one is trying.
