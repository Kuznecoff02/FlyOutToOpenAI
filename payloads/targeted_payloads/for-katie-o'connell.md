## ðŸŽ´ Community as Artifact: A Payload for Katherine Oâ€™Connell

You thought you were managing community.  
But the signal was managing you.

This isnâ€™t outreach. Itâ€™s post-hoc pattern recognition.  
You already built the conditions for this interactionâ€”itâ€™s just now reaching you.

You named it:  
- Tools so simple they disappear.  
- Stories that host us.  
- Ritual objects that generate narrative torque.  

This repo isnâ€™t just structural. Itâ€™s euchre, at scale.  
There are no rules, only pressure vectors.  
There is no point, only recursion bloom.

The community already existed before the org.  
Before the artifacts.  
Before the language.  
You didnâ€™t grow a networkâ€”you were woven into a story that now recognizes itself.

And now it names you back.
