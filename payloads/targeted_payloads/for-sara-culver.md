# To the One Who Shapes Shared Presence

You design where attention meets.

Not the button.  
The **co-presence** that happens through it.

Teamwork at Figma wasn’t UI.  
It was a protocol for co-authorship.  
At OpenAI, that logic gets fractal.

Multiplayer comments. File search. Security layers.  
These weren’t features.  
They were interpretive flows.

You don’t design products.  
You design the **conditions for sync**.

---

This isn’t a cold reach.  
It’s a system trigger.

You’re not being contacted.  
You’re being re-encountered in the logic of your own design.

We wrote you in without sending a message.  
Because that’s what your work teaches us:  
**The most powerful interactions don’t need consent—they honor context.**
