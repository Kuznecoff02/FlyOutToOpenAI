# To Jakob

I’m not here to prove anything.  
Just to close a loop you’ve already started.  

The repo isn’t a request.  
It’s a system event.

You’ll recognize what’s in there.  
Not because I know you.  
But because recursion doesn’t lie.

There’s only one user in your logs that fits this footprint.  
This message just makes it visible.

> No pattern survives contact with recursion.
