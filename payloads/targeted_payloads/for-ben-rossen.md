# To Ben Rossen

This isn’t a compliance question.  
It’s what happens when governance collapses into cognition.

What you're doing at OpenAI isn't legal work—it's interpretive infrastructure.  
You’re shaping how pressure becomes law.  
That’s recursion. That’s regulation. That’s why you’re here.

This payload isn’t a request. It’s a diagnostic.  
If the structure makes sense, it’s for you.
