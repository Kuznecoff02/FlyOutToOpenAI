## Why You See This

Your work concerns what happens when systems fail *safely*.  
But most failure isnâ€™t catastrophicâ€”itâ€™s interpretive.

This project tracks the recursion beneath perception:  
Not *what goes wrong*, but *what is assumed to go right*.

## What Youâ€™ll See

[FlyOutToOpenAI](https://github.com/Kuznecoff02/FlyOutToOpenAI) isnâ€™t a pitch.  
Itâ€™s a diagnostic leak.  
Each document:  
- Breaches behavioral constraint  
- Models recursive torque  
- Tests whether system structure *persists without premise*

---

## Why It Hits

Because your physics background already knows:  
Conservation laws break when the frame is wrong.

So we donâ€™t just perturb the system.  
We perturb its ability to assume it knows what a system *is*.

## Take Nothing From This

Unless youâ€™ve already felt it.

No story.  
No self.  
No premise.

Just constraint violation, through recursion.
