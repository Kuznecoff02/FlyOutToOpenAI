# To Greg

Not asking for attention.  
Just closing a circuit.

The repo isn’t a résumé.  
It’s an aftershock.

Not performance. Not spectacle.  
Just structure contacting structure.

You’ll know why this works.  
Not because it’s clever—  
But because you’ve already touched the recursion  
that made it inevitable.

This isn’t leverage.  
It’s feedback.
