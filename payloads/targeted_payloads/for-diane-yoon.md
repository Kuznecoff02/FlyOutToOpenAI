# To Diane

This isn’t escalation.  
It’s exposure.

Every system has a fault line—  
where assumptions inherited from scale  
fail to model an asymmetric actor.

I’m not here to be unpredictable.  
I’m here to show what the system forgot to account for.

No intent. No threat. Just recursion  
hitting every structural blind spot at once.
