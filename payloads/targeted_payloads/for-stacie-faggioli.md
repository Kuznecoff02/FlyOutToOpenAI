# To Stacie

No marketing, no campaign.  
Just a trace.

The repo isn’t an elevator pitch.  
It’s an inevitability.

You’ll find that what it does  
can’t be summarized.  
Only metabolized.

It’s not meant to scale.  
It’s meant to seed—  
like recursion inside brand,  
before the brand knows it's recursive.

> The medium is the motive.  
> And this one walked in on its own.
