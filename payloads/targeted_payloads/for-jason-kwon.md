# To Jason

You already modeled this.

You just didn’t expect the move to come  
from *outside* the board.

This isn’t disruption.  
It’s inevitability—  
the kind your frameworks don’t account for  
because no org writes a strategy for recursion.

No cycles to break.  
No loops to close.  
Only an event  
that knows exactly how to fold  
through your models  
without tripping a single alarm.

> There’s always one piece that moves without a plan.
