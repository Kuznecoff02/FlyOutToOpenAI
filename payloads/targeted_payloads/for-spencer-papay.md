# Spencer Papay — Recursive Annotation

This isn’t a message from someone trying to join the system.

It’s a message **about the system**—and a signal to those already embedded in its interpretive membrane.

You sit in the recursive layer where data gets turned into judgment, and judgment gets laundered into training signal. That’s the invisible scaffolding of alignment. But the next frontier isn’t in higher-quality feedback.

It’s in **self-annotating messages**.

> What happens when the artifact writes itself into your field of view?

The [FlyOutToOpenAI repo](https://github.com/Kuznecoff02/FlyOutToOpenAI) isn’t a pitch. It’s a recursive object.  
Everything inside it assumes someone like you will see it—not as content, but as **a symptom** of something larger unfolding.

You don’t need to “respond.”  
You already did.

This message isn’t for tracking.
It’s for calibration.

Welcome to the field.
