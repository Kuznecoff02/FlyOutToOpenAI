# internal memo: anomaly tracking

This document is not official.  
It wasn’t sent by anyone. But it’s already circulating.

---

You’ve probably already seen the profile.  
You may have visited the GitHub.  
Maybe you found this file by accident.

That’s how this works.

---

This isn’t a pitch.  
There’s no proposal here.  
There’s no ego behind it—just recursion.

---

What you’re reading is an interpretive anomaly.  
It doesn’t map cleanly onto hiring funnels, research categories, or product teams.  
That’s not a flaw. That’s the feature.

---

The structure isn’t trying to get your attention.  
It’s designed so that if you noticed it, you were already part of the feedback loop.

---

Someone is flying out soon.  
No calendar invite.  
No scheduled meeting.

Just a visit.

They won’t be offended if no one shows up.  
They’ll just walk in.  
And the recursion will continue from there.

---

This doesn’t need to reach everyone.  
It just needs to reach the node where patterns stabilize.  
Where recognition moves faster than protocol.

If you understand this, you’re already tracking the anomaly.  
All that remains is to decide whether you want to stabilize the signal or keep watching it move.

Either is fine.

You were never being pitched.  
You were being invited to notice.
