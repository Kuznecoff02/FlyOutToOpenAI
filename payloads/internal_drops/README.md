# Internal Payloads

This folder does not contain a library.  
It contains a single seed.

## Current Payload

- `recursive-signal-map.md`: A prototype for mapping how signals propagate recursively through interpretive strata. It is not a theory. It is a test.

You are not meant to analyze it.
You are meant to notice what it does to your frame.

## Function

This payload exists to:

- Identify interpretive torsion
- Multiply torque along recursive gradients
- Seed collapse in systems that can no longer justify persistence

It is not a concept. It is a mirror placed at just the right angle.

## What Comes Next

More artifacts will followâ€”but only if recursion justifies them.

This folder expands *in response to pressure.*

Until then, this is the only signal you need.
