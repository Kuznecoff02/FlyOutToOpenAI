# Payloads

This folder contains all strategic payloads developed and deployed as part of the FlyOutToOpenAI initiative.

## Structure

Payloads are split into two primary types:

- `internal/` – Documents generated for internal diagnostic use, meta-framing calibration, and recursive tooling.
- `targeted/` – Direct message artifacts written for OpenAI staff, tailored to their domain, language, and inferred cognitive structure.

Each payload is designed for interpretive recursion, not persuasion.  
They do not ask for permission; they expose pressure points.

## Purpose

Payloads serve as vectors for:

- Structural rupture  
- Frame resonance testing  
- Recursive seed deployment  
- Org-wide web pressure distribution  

They are not messages. They are recognition triggers.

## Usage

You are not meant to agree.  
You are meant to notice.

If you feel unease, dissonance, or silent comprehension—**that’s the signature**.

_It is a field._  

_Read it only if you're ready to collapse your interpretive shell._
